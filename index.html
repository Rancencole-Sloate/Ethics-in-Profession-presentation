    <h2>The Intention of the Invention:</h2>
      <h2><em>Video games and their effect on todays youth</em></h2>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>“Video games are bad for you? That’s what they said about rock-n-roll.” (Expressed by Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of Mario Bros) Mankind makes blanket statements about the influence of a controversial topic such as video games. Pushing one to look past the easy and research the opposite is arduous and unpopular. Mankind should strive to understand the means of something before an informed opinion is made. “Any of various games involving images, controlled by players, on an electronic screen. noun. Interactive software that is used for entertainment, role-playing, and simulation. Video games are played on a Windows PC, mobile device, or specialized gaming consoles such as an Xbox or PlayStation." (“Yourdictionary.” Dictionary, https://www.yourdictionary.com.) Most people are familiar with video games. Video games are incredibly widespread, a global activity that connects people across all populated continents. In America alone, there are over 200 million video game users from statistics in 2020 (WePlay Holding, “How Many People Play Video Games in the World” https://weplayholding.com/ ). That statistic is incredible considering the outlook of video games 50 years ago. In October of 1958 at Brookhaven National Laboratory’s instrumentation group in Upton Long Island, a physicist by the name of William Higinbotham assembled an idea for a technology-based interactive game. Nicknamed Tennis for 2, the game was displayed on the Laboratory’s interactive panel. This allowed guests to engage in new inventions the group had devised. However, William’s invention was by far the most popular among the people. They were amazed by the device despite it being “not too special” as described by William. Years later.  A company by the name of Atari would end up creating the now-classic Pong game, based on Higinbotham’s Tennis for 2. Soon video games stormed the world like a tornado, this led to the creation of arcades and arcade classics like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Mario Bros, and Space Invaders. Eventually, video games would no longer be restricted to the arcade and could be taken home. With the creation of home video game consoles like the Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System, families could enjoy hours of fun from the comfort of their living room. Video games advanced again to be played on the go with the invention of the Game boy. Gamers soon leaped into the 3D realm with the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Sega Dreamcast. Today, revolutionary innovations continue to be created within the video game market. The creation of virtual reality headsets allows players the reality of being inside a video game world. This is possible with special simulated environments and motion trackers inside the headset. Video games have come far since their humble beginnings. This success and popularity doesn't mean the industry hasn't had difficulty along the way.</p>
      <p>Since the mid-to-late ’90s, video games have become embroiled in controversy. Beginning with the creation of action game titles such as the fighting game series by Midway, Mortal Kombat. The controversy heightened with first-person shooters by Id Software Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake. The most infamous and disputed of all games is Rockstar’s popular 3rd person shooter and crime simulator Grand Theft Auto. These games are known to contain extreme violence, blood, gore, and in Grand theft Auto’s case, extremely foul language and sexual content. These games are exceedingly controversial at the time of their release and in 1993 they sparked congressional hearings about violence and content in video games. There is an ongoing debate about video games content and that it, in turn, hinders the physical and mental capabilities of children, among whom video games are the most popular. However, in the past 20 years, scientists and other research teams have been conducting studies and have evidence that points to video games improving a person's life rather than destroying it. The evidence that will be uncovered includes studies on how video games affect adolescents’ cognitive development, the social benefits of video games, and their improvement of mental integrity. All prove that, video games are beneficial to adolescents</p>
      <h3><em>Proof 1</em><h3>
      <h3><em>Cognitive Development</em></h3>
      <P>“In layman’s terms, playing video games directly affects and impacts regions of the brain responsible for memory, spatial orientation, information organizations, and fine motor skills.” (Vince Steffano, “Yes, Video Games are Good...for Your Mind and Body” Id Tech, www.idtech.com ). The phrase “Video games rot the brain” insinuates that video games are mindless violence and action with no educational or beneficial content. However, quite the opposite has been found through much research. Video games, while being a heightened form of entertainment, are one of the most widespread methods of cognitive development, which Merriam Webster defines as “the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.”  Video Games have been extensively studied and proved to be a catalyst for the improvement of the brain’s most important functions.  The very functions used in the everyday routine, motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and memorization ability.
Motor skills are a “function that involves specific movements of the body's muscles to perform a certain task. These tasks could include walking, running, or riding a bike.” (Britannica Encyclopedia, Merriam Webster Dictionary .https://www.merriam-webster.com) They are crucial to physical activity. Motor skills are responsible for all the previously mentioned actions, as well as more physically demanding tasks such as sports performance and writing proficiency. The Society for Research in Child Development has stated how important it is for children to constantly improve and build upon them as they go through school. “Motor skills are a critical part of children's developing social competencies and physical well-being 9-11 and are a gateway to engagement in learning and social activities, including sports and games, throughout the school years 8, 12.” (Cameron, Claire E. “How Are Motor Skills Linked to Children's School Performance and Academic Achievement?” SRCD, srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com) Video games contribute to these years and the growth adolescents need and the body and mind expect.</p>
<p><em>“People who play action video games learn new sensorimotor skills more quickly than non-gamers do, according to a study by psychology researchers at the University of Toronto. A new sensorimotor skill, such as riding a bike or typing, requires forming a new pattern of coordination between vision and motor movement.”</em></p>
        <p>(Science Connected, “Action Video Games Boost Sensorimotor Skills” https://magazine.scienceconnected.org) 
Video games allow adolescents to constantly stimulate and connect parts of the brain that work to develop skills and key components such as complex multitasking, vision, and movement. Those enhanced motor skills bring refined quality of life improvements and excelled performance.
      </p>
  <h3><em>Hand-Eye Coordination</em></h3>
  <p>Hand-eye coordination is necessary and present for a child’s healthy and successful incline of these critical stages of development.</p>  
<p><em>“The ability of the vision system to coordinate the information received through the eyes to control, guide, and direct the hands in the accomplishment of a given task, such as handwriting or catching a ball. Hand-eye coordination uses the eyes to direct attention and the hands to execute a task.” </em></p>
<p>(Encyclopedia of Children’s Health Dictionary http://www.healthofchildren.com)
 In a similar vein to motor skills, hand-eye coordination is a heavily important aspect of physical capabilities, some people believe it to be even more necessary than motor skills for a child to excel academically and physically.</p> 
  <p></em>“Hand-eye coordination is a crucial ability that lies at the core of many academic, sports, and life skills. It is a vital skill for school success because it allows children to use their vision and muscles to perform tasks such as writing, drawing, tying shoelaces, or catching a ball.” </em></p>
    <p>(MyFirstApp, “How to Improve Hand-Eye Coordination at a Young Age?” https://myfirstapp.com/) 
Specific video games that include quick response and attention to detail improve the adolescents' frontal and parietal cortex, which network together to improve the complex movements of hand-eye coordination.</p>
<p><em>“A recent study from the University of Toronto found that people who regularly play video games, particularly action titles like ‘Call of Duty’ or ‘Assassin’s Creed’, perform better in sensorimotor tasks and improve hand-eye coordination, than people who do not play video games…the 2014 study found that adolescents who played more showed an increase in cortical thickness in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left frontal eye field, indicating greater density and more brain cell connections and thus improved brain function in those areas…The left frontal eye field is a part of the brain that plays a large role in processing visual-motor information, it is also involved with making judgments about how to react to external stimuli. It’s important in decision-making because it allows us to efficiently figure out what sort of reaction best suits what is happening around us.”</em></p>     
  <p>(Vision Works “Do video games actually improve hand-eye coordination?” https://www.vision-works.com)
Before each movement that a body decides to make, these parts of the brain contain patterns of neural activity, which can be used to predict the body’s next movement. Allowing reasonable repetitive actions and exposure to these video games improves physical performance in adolescents. Exposure to these video games improves physical prowess in adolescents’ academic tasks and physical ability.
  </p>
<h3><em>Memorization</em></h3>
<P>The ability to recall information and movements without intention is what we look for in a strong memory. Memory is “the process by which we encode information, store it, and eventually retrieve it” (Hodent, Celia. 2021. Routledge. Taylor & Francis group. The Psychology of Video Games. 8) Memorization is utilized in many aspects of life such as quoting a written excerpt from a book or speech, acting or singing, and most importantly, remembering what one’s mother said as means of advice or guidance. Memorization skills are used every day, some more efficiently than others. A study in 2014 found that individuals who play video games consistently had better memorization abilities and efficiency than non-video game-playing volunteers. </p>
<p><em>“The new study found that people who played video games as children showed greater improvements in their working memory than those who did not, suggesting that video games can have long-lasting benefits for cognition…This study combined video game playing with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive form of brain stimulation that scientists have studied as a treatment for mood disorders…At the end of each session, the researchers applied TMS to part of the prefrontal cortex, which is at the front of the brain and is important for complex cognitive functions, such as working memory and reasoning.”</em><p>
  <p>(Bird, Eleanor “Video gaming as a child related to improvements in memory” https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/)
Here we understand that adolescents who play video games will generally perform better on things like tests, quizzes, and drama plays than their peers.</p>
<h3><em>Summary of Proof 1</em></h3>
<p>Video games improve necessary academic and life abilities such as motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and memorization capabilities. Video games are found to help the brain rather than hinder it. Mankind is designed to use and exercise the brain every single day, man cannot function without a brain. Beloved past President Ronald Regan shared, “I recently learned something quite interesting about video games. Many young people have developed incredible hand, eye, and brain coordination in playing these games. The air force believes these kids will be our outstanding pilots should they fly our jets.” (Regan, Ronald, )  President Regan’s words ring more true today than 30+ years ago. If something, like playing video games, can improve the brains of the younger generation, and add benefits to lives, why would we extract it from the years most crucial to growing and developing minds?</p>
<h3><em>Proof 2</em></h3>
<h3><em>Social Benefits</em></h3>
<p>While further nurturing the physical aspect of the brain, video games help give a push towards greater social beneficiaries. Since video games have hit mainstream media, there have been a multitude of video game communities. Both in reality and the digital world. Those with a love for video games have led from the creation of huge online gaming forums such as Game FAQ’s and Gamespot boards to massive conventions such as PAX (Penny Arcade Expo), The Game Awards, and the Electronic Entertainment Expo.  E3 has been considered the largest gaming expo of the year. Gaming presents an opportunity for people to come together and connect with each other and has brought another avenue for great social growth.</p>
<p>“Increased positive social experiences, expansion of social circles, elevating self-confidence and improving self-esteem through fun leisure programming in the community.” (Britannica Encyclopedia, Merriam Webster Dictionary .https://www.merriam-webster.com) a definition for what is known as social growth. Video games give adolescents the confidence to step out of their comfort zone and make friends, contrast to the misconception that video games cause adolescents to become shut in and reclusive. While it can not be narrowed down to a specific way video games help people become more social, the statistics of how many people play video games with friends heavily outweighs compared to them played alone, signifying there is something about video games that encourages sociability.</p>
<p>“More than 70 percent of gamers play with a friend, and millions of people worldwide participate in massive virtual worlds through video games such as "Farmville" and "World of Warcraft," the article noted. Multiplayer games become virtual social communities, where decisions need to be made quickly about whom to trust or reject and how to lead a group, the authors said. People who play video games, even if they are violent, that encourage cooperation are more likely to be helpful to others while gaming than those who play the same games competitively, a 2011 study found"...“Multiplayer and online games allow for constant communication between players which results in the development of both meaningful and casual relationships.” (American Psychological Association “Video game play may provide learning, health, social benefits, review finds” Vol 45 No. 2 https://www.apa.org) There has always been a common misconception that video gamers are antisocial, however video gamers are always pushing themselves to be a collective.
  Video games promote people’s ability to become social.</p>
<h3><em>Summary of Proof 2</h3></em>
  <p>Playing video games allows adolescents to be connected and not alone. During the Covid-19 pandemic, studies and statistics show that children need friends and connectivity. When faced with an uncertain future on what the new reality will be, video games are an avenue to provide an outlet that gives what adolescents need, a spark, and a platform to make and maintain friendships.</p>
<h3><em>Proof 3</em></h3>
<h3><em>Creativity and Mental Integrity</em></h3>
<p>“Video games foster the mindset that allows creativity to grow.” - Nolan Bushnell (Businessman who helped to establish Atari.) Similar to books, movies, art, and poems can become a comfort to oneself, video games are a source of imagination and mental stability. Many video games often present colorful and unique worlds filled with a standout ensemble of characters, lore, and environments. Games such as God of War, Spider-Man 2018, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Uncharted 4: a Thief's End, contain realistic stories and personalities that allow adolescents to relate to and better one’s character. With these factors in mind, video games allow adolescents to improve their mental state with promotions of artistic inspiration and perseverance.</p>
<h3></em>Artistc Inspiration</em></h3>
<p>Artistic inspiration is “a feeling of enthusiasm you get from someone or something, which gives you new and creative ideas.” (Collins Dictionary https://www.collinsdictionary.com/ ) Adolescents are known for their creativity, being the most creative on the planet. To keep this healthy mindset, video games constantly strive to be oozing with creative influence. This environment keeps children actively daydreaming and imagining themselves in the unique and inspiring world of a video game, keeping their artistic mindset in a healthy place.</p>
<p><em>“A study of nearly 500 12-year-olds found that the more kids played video games, the more creative they were in tasks such as drawing pictures and writing stories…Linda Jackson, professor of psychology and lead researcher on the project, said the study appears to be the first evidence-based demonstration of a relationship between technology use and creativity.” </em></p>
<p>(Michigan State University “Video game playing tied to creativity” https://msutoday.msu.edu/).
As mentioned previously, video games are colorful and captivating with expansive lore. This spurs adolescents with a desire to build their own narratives and create personal takes around these universes, fueling their creative minds and ensuring they keep a healthy mental state.</p>
<h3><em>Goals</em></h3>
<p>Goals are “the object of a person's ambition or effort; an aim or desired result.” (Oxford dictionary) There's always a goal in a person's life, whether it's for religious purposes, work purposes or, importantly, mind goals. An adolescent is known to be filled with unbridled optimism and, luckily, video games nurture that drive. Video games have always been forerunners in attempting to push problem-solving in ways they would not have been exposed to otherwise.</p>
<p><em>“Scientists from the Queen Mary University of London and University College London (UCL) recruited 72 volunteers, asking them to play video games for 40 hours over six to eight weeks…At the beginning of the study, the researchers measured the volunteers’ cognitive flexibility, described as the ability to adapt and switch between tasks, as well as think about multiple ideas at a given time to solve problems. Basically, cognitive flexibility is how fast a person can think on his or her feet…The volunteers were split into three groups. The first two were trained to play different versions of a real-time strategy game called StarCraft, a fast-paced game where players have to build and organize armies to battle an enemy. The third group played a life simulation video game called The Sims, which does not require much memory or many tactics…After undergoing a variety of psychological tests, the researchers discovered that those who played StarCraft were quicker and more accurate in performing cognitive flexibility tasks than those who played The Sims. ‘Previous research has demonstrated that action video games, such as Halo, can speed up decision making, but the current work finds that real-time strategy games can also promote our ability to think on the fly and learn from past mistakes,’ said Brian Glass, Ph.D., from Queen Mary’s School of Biological and Chemical Sciences.”</em></p>
 <p>(Wood, Janice “Playing Video Games Can Boost Fast Thinking” psychcentral.com) Video games don't turn the brain into mush. Instead, countless games like id software’s Doom and Quake, FormSoft’s Dark Souls trilogy, and Microsoft's Halo Encourage players to keep striving to finish or complete hard tasks. They promote perseverance and the player’s ability to rise to the challenge. Overcoming difficult hurdles and learning from one’s mistakes are the base concepts acquired in strategy games.</p>
<h3><em>Summary of Proof 3</em></h3>
<p>Video Games improve an adolescent’s mental state by reinforcing the attitude of “never-give-up” and the comfort of the irresistible worlds that can be expressed into art. As in relation to current events, staying inside for extended time and spending days, weeks, and months in one’s own house crippled social opportunities for adolescents. A ray of light in the recent epidemic, video games provide a much-needed escape from the stresses of life and help adolescents feel free from the constraints of their home’s walls.</p>
<h3><em>Refutation</em></h3>
<h3><em>Introduction</em></h3>
<p>Video games have always been embroiled in controversy, and some would agree “rightfully so”. Many people would say video games are extremely controversial and possibly even dangerous with some containing a multitude of blood and gore, deplorable activities, and a surplus of foul language. Since Congress held the 1993 hearings, video games have, often, been in the epicenter of drama. To represent the opposite side, video games controversy has been inevitable because of its obvious ties to violence. There are many games with guns, shootouts, and wars, which are believed to encourage an adolescent to be agitated and have a chance to become violent. Video games can be inappropriate. Games like Grand Theft Auto and all shooter games present an adolescent with mature content not fit for their age. With these points in mind, video games would be seen as not beneficial to adolescents.</p>
<h3><em>Proof 1</em><h3>
  <h3><em>Violence</em></h3>
<p>Oxford Dictionary defines violence as “behavior involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something.”  violence is not to be taken lightly, it is a pathway of pain and trouble for both parties. What can start as a simple skirmish has the possibility to evolve into some more, something far worse if it is left to fester thanks to constant exposure, and video games don't shy away from violence. Video games can contribute to increased aggravation and volatile emotions from adolescents.</p>
<p><em>“Playing violent video games like Doom, Wolfenstein 3D or Mortal Kombat can increase a person's aggressive thoughts, feelings and behavior both in laboratory settings and in actual life, according to two studies appearing in the April issue of the American Psychological Association's (APA) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Furthermore, violent video games may be more harmful than violent television and movies because they are interactive, very engrossing, and require the player to identify with the aggressor, say the researchers.” </em></p>
  <p>(Craig A Anderson, Karen E Dill, 2000“Video Games, and Aggressive Thoughts, Feelings, and Behavior in the Laboratory and in Life” www.apa.org)<p>
  <h3><em>Summary of Proof 1</em></h3>
<p>Video games can give adolescents the idea that being angry is encouraged, which can lead to awful repercussions in life.</p>
  <h3><em>Proof 2</em></h3>
  <h3><em>Innapropriate Content</em></h3>
  <p>Inappropriate content is defined by InternetMatters.org, as “information or images that upset your child, material that's directed at adults, inaccurate information or information that might lead your child into unlawful or dangerous behavior.” Some video games have inappropriate content for children, while it may hold the truth that the gameplay style could hold merit in improving an adolescent’s life skills, the content nonetheless is revolting and deplorable. The gameplay itself may be able to help with motor skills or hand-eye coordination, but how will the content inside the game affect the young player’s moral compass?</p>
  <h3><em>Debunking Refutation</em></h3>
  <p>Even taking these concerns as serious, negative connotations, there's still an argument to be made that video games are beneficial to adolescents with reduced ties to violence and parental supervision and involvement. There has been a multitude of studies conducted that have debunked the common theory of video games influence violence.</p>
 <p><em>“The APA’s division for media psychology and technology was much more dismissive of any causal link. In a policy statement on June 22, 2017, it found “scant evidence” of any causal connection between playing violent video games and actually committing violent activities” and “little evidence” that playing such games “produces violent criminal behavior.”</em></p>
  <P>(Boffey, Phillip M. Dana Foundation“Do Violent Video Games Lead to Violence?” Dana.org)</p>
 <p>Violence in video games has become one of the most researched fields in psychology. Researchers repeatedly come up with little connection between the two. While it is true prolonged and unmonitored exposure to video games can cause an adolescent to have more aggressive tendencies, it has been studied to not escalate any farther than heightened emotions and shows no certainty to potential lethal violence.</p>
<p>In addition, saying violent video games lead to real-world violence is an inflated idea. As psycholinguistics and discourse analysis expert and professor of Arizona State University James Paul Gee states;</p> 
<p><em>“Some people have those videogames are somehow more potent than movies or books because the player does things in the virtual world via his or her avatar. This is akin, I suppose, to the claim that because I have planted lots of corn in Harvest Moon I will run out and plant corn in my backyard - in reality, we have as little as real corn from Harvest Moon as we have real Killings from Grand Theft Auto.”</em></p> <p>(James Paul Gee, 2008 “What video games have to teach us about Learning and Literacy”. 12)</p>
<p>Regardless of a connection to violence, a parent should always be aware of what one’s child is playing. An adolescent player should not be left to self-monitor the exposure and time on devices.</p>
<p>The solution to helping an adolescent refrain from seeing inappropriate content is to have parental moderation. A parent should not leave their child unattended or be carefree when video games are involved. There are plenty of games that copiously contain content too mature for adolescent viewing. The parent must be active to know the themes and components of which they are exposing their children. After the 1993 congressional hearings about video games and the content within, a rating system was mandated. At that time the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB) was formed to score a video game based on its content. Rankings extend from E for everyone to an M rating for mature audiences. The ESRB rating outlines what content is inside a video game and is meant to be used by parents to inform themselves about the game's content. ESRB outlines all the details found within the game and is on the back of a game’s box. In addition, on the ESRB website, viewers find a game's rating and more in-depth information by providing the context for a particular rating. Furthermore, modern advancements have made it quite easy for parents to know what their child is being exposed to within a video game, and parents must decide what is appropriate and what should be avoided. The game publisher provides the content, the parents must monitor what exposure is allowed for the child.</p>
  <h3><em>Summary of Refutation</em></h3>
  <p>Video games may not be beneficial to adolescents because of the violence in video games connection and the content within some video games. To clarify, the purpose is not to justify the content within the mature games. The purpose is to provide evidence that the gameplay of age-appropriate games improves crucial developmental skills in an adolescent’s life. It is not debatable that the themes of games like Grand Theft Auto are completely controversial and inappropriate, rather that the statement to be made is that strategic, teamworking, and quick action games build skills in the child's mind that will allow them to naturally excel in areas like academics, sports, social abilities, and an improved mental state.<p>
  <h3><em>Conclusion</em></h3>
  <p>There is immutable and undeniable evidence that video games are beneficial to adolescents. Video games give children an increased chance to succeed in outdoor activities and gain increased academic prowess. A child’s motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and memorization abilities can be improved from monitored and strategic exposure to video games.</p>
  <p>“Video Games rot the brain” Is no longer applicable in this day in age. Ample proof of published studies actively proves it wrong. Gaming gives an opportunity for children to enhance friendships. Children are allowed to grow friendships on the playgrounds, in extracurricular activities, and now in the virtual universe as gamers. Gaming actively encourages the child to make friends rather than play alone. People who say gamers are “antisocial” are taking the action of playing indoors at face value. Video games help to keep the mental stability of children intact. They encourage children to keep the mental mindset of “never give and keep on keeping on” Games allow children to imagine themselves in a world to help alleviate life's obstacles. Video games are an outlet for stress relief and goal setters. These games are more than moving pictures someone can interact with, they are mental workouts useful for children as an education beneficiary and a metaphorical mind “Gym”</p>
  <p>Are all video games for everyone? No, they are not. Some video games contain content with which no child should have interaction. This thesis did not argue that all content within video games is appropriate for adolescents, but instead, that video games as a whole show statistics of being helpful and improving an adolescent’s life. Keeping all this in mind, it is also very important to note that it is not being argued that children should play video games all the time or games should replace education. Children should not be left with an unfamiliar video game, unmonitored, or left gaming for extended periods of time, even if they do provide helpful benefits. Video games may provide a means of improvement in an adolescent’s academic abilities, but it is not to replace a solid education. </p>
  <p>Video games are similar to a working man's hammer. It is a valued and useful tool that comes in handy for many occasions and can, in a sense, become enjoyable to use. But it cannot be a supplement for every other tool in his belt. It too has been used as a means of violence when in the wrong hands. This has labeled the hammer as both a helper for mankind and a weapon of war.  We must keep in mind the intention of the invention. The hammer, akin to video games, was created to help, enjoy, build, and stimulate the minds of those who wanted or needed it. Mankind has accepted and endorsed the hammer. When will it be time to open minds to the benefits of video games?</p>
